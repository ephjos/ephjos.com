        <p>
        I had a realization today that I <i>think</i> I may be able to get
        my old Haskell ray tracer up and working. As it turns out, I may have
        been completely wrong when expecting the program to be able to
        generate high-resolution images. The implementation obviously has its
        flaws, however I think I was simply expecting too much of it. This
        clicked when I realized that the book suggests using much lower
        resolutions than I expected when rendering. Even for a completely
        blank canvas, the design of the program will lead to high memory usage.
        This usage quickly exceeds what is feasible, aside from other
        implementation details.

        <p>
        I am going to max out my python implementation at 640x480 images and
        try to finish the book. If I find myself inspired, I'll loop
        back to my Haskell implementation (still hidden in my git history)
        and try the same there.

        <p>
        I don't know why this never hit me before, but I'll chalk it up to
        the Covid outbreak starting while I worked on this. That sounds like
        a good enough excuse to me :)

        <p>
        The affect that perspective and time spent away from a problem
        can have on one's perception of the problem will always surprise me.
        This seems dead simple to me now.
