        <p>
          While checking out the
          <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/master/tool/viz/life.c">
            source code for the Game of Life implementation in cosmopolitan libc</a>
          I was introduced to the concept of bitboards. I was aware of using bit-level
          logic for performance and memory reasons, but I did not know that there
          was a specific name for applying this to games. The cosmopolitan source calls
          out
          <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf">
            Bitboard Methods for Games by Cameron Browne</a>, which is
          a great resource. It is clear to me how this approach can be used to
          implement Conway's Game of Life and other grid based games. The obvious way
          to improve such systems is to parallelize the computation across the
          board. I've gone the GPU accelerated route before but it never
          occurred to me that a similar result can be accomplished using bit-wise
          operations.

          As an exercise in understanding, I wanted to implement something not
          explicitly called out in the above paper. I went with tic-tac-toe,
          since it is simple enough to do in short amount of time.
          <a href="https://github.com/ephjos/ttt-bitboard">
            I implemented something in C</a>, and I am happy with how it went.
          I am not thrilled with the board printing logic, it feels like there
          should be an easier way to map an int to a string of output without
          using a mask for each bit. I'm sure that I could do away with the usage
          of pointers and replace some of the conditionals, but I don't know how
          much is left to be gained there.
          While not groundbreaking, this was interesting and I would like to look
          at applying this to more complex problems starting with cellular automata.

          When I first started programming, I remember implementing tic-tac-toe
          in Java. I used 2D arrays (tic-tac-toe is probably a great introduction
          to this idea, but is far from optimal) and had plenty of loops
          to check win conditions. The input handling was janky and the output
          was a mess. I spent a lot of time writing logic to make the class
          general, which was definitely a waste of time. This seems to be a common
          issue, especially in Object Oriented code, but that is a topic for
          another day. While it is nothing fancy, I know myself from Tenth grade
          would think that this is cool.
