        Sometimes, I find myself feeling deep appreciation for
        well-designed libraries. This happens every time I have to write
        my own matrix manipulation code. The actual mathematics is
        not too difficult, and neither is the implementation (optimization
        aside), but making a good interface is a pain. I will always
        appreciate numpy and how seamless it is to use the ndarray.
        The entire library is a great example of an extremely
        performant backend and a stupid simple interface. Making such
        a powerful tool so easy to use will always impress and inspire me.

        <p>
        I like numpy :)
