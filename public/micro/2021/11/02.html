        python is almost always a pleasure to use. I find that is helps
        drastically lower the barrier between my brain and the computer,
        letting ideas quickly become code without much friction. While this
        may not be great for maintainability long-term, it is
        great for "just doing" something which is often my goal. I like
        using type systems and compiled languages, but I think python is
        a better choice in most cases as it lets me focus on the problem at
        hand without much effort. I should use python more often, especially
        for pet projects.

        <p>
        Use the right tool for the job.
