        I stumbled onto the Wikipedia page for
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">
          Parkinson's law</a> today, and was intrigued. I had never heard this
        name used for describing this specific phenomenon.
        This aligns with the idea of scope creep which often comes up in
        software engineering. We often view extra resources as an opportunity
        to do more, which can be extremely detrimental to the goal of the
        project.

        <p>
        This concept was referenced regarding this great post about
        <a href="https://mzrn.sh/2021/11/14/how-i-helped-build-a-profitable-mvp-over-a-weekend"> building a profitable MVP in a weekend</a>.
        This MVP was successful due to the owner being well connected and
        experienced in the space, but also due to an aggressively small
        scope. Instead of focusing on what is possible in a weekend and
        listing out features, the author instead focused on whittling
        down the app to the smallest possible size. This narrow focus allowed
        them to ship in a weekend and start making money.

        <p>
        This is something that I am trying to apply to my projects, both
        before and during them. I have become much more comfortable with
        erasing ideas from my project list before starting them. Once started,
        I actively work to <i>reduce</i> the amount of work remaining. This
        leads to me focusing on more important tasks while working on and
        finishing them more consistently.

        <p>
        The space of projects I <i>could</i>
        do is infinite, but my time is not. Being able to pick out the most
        valuable and fun projects from that space will give me the highest
        yield for my effort. Once started, instead of drumming up new features
        to add, it is almost always a better idea to start something new.
