        Lately, I've been going through a weird distraction cycle with this
        website. Every few days, I'll convince myself that I have to
        make some massive change to the project's structure, introduce
        new technologies, and further complicate things. Down the rabbit
        hole I go for a couple hours before clarity bonks me over the head.
        "I don't need this" I think to myself as I realize the time I just
        wasted.

        <p>
        As stated before, I get distracted by new tools and features incredibly
        easily. By intentionally keeping the scope of this site small and
        boring overall, I give myself more time to actually fill it with
        content. I am hoping that I can shorten these distraction cycles
        further, hopefully to the point where they stop happening. Here's some
        reminders for myself.

        <ul>
          <li>This site does not need markdown</li>
          <li>The most you have ever written is with this current setup</li>
          <li>The deploy process does not need new tools brought into it</li>
          <li>The goal here is to write and stay minimal, not to tinker with new toys</li>
          <li>If I want to try something out, I can do it separate from this site</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Here are some changes that I will consider for the future:

      <ul>
        <li>
          More efficient builds (don't rebuild index pages and RSS feeds from
          scratch every time)
        </li>
        <li>
          Scope index pages to N most recent posts, create separate archive
          page with all of the posts to keep indexes small
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop a simple tool to do SSI at build time, reduce the work of
          the server.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      In reality, these are all fairly low leverage activities but they all
      provide some value towards efficiency and keeping things clean. For now,
      none of that is needed and I'd rather spend my effort on writing and
      other projects.
