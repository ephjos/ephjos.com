        I take back what I said the other day about reorganizing my
        python code for the Ray Tracer Challenge; I moved the code into
        modules. Its been a while since I've done this, so there were plenty
        of things I got wrong, but I am happy with it now. I broke the
        code into three directories: rtc, test, demo. This allowed me to
        break tests and demos out into separate files, which prevents
        the circular import issues. The tests can be run using
        the unittest module's discover functionality. The demos
        are run by running the module directly which calls the
        <code>demo/__main__.py</code> file.

        <p>
        This was a small reorganization and I like the result. In the past,
        I usually just filled directories with python files, but I can
        how this would have been useful for some larger projects.
        I'll approach this like optimization: only do it when it becomes
        necessary. I am reminded of the famous quote:

        <blockquote>
          Premature optimization is the root of all evil
          <div>
            - Donald Knuth
          </div>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        I'll use modules once the individual files become a mess,
        but stick to the files where I can.

        As of now, I am going to try posting here 3 days a week: Tuesday,
        Thursday, and Saturday (or Sunday). I also want to write longer posts
        on the main blog, but don't know how often I can get to that. I am
        still going to try to write every day but not force myself to post
        rushed writing.
