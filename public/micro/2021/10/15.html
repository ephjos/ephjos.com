        After briefly getting into racket's vectors, I am becoming a bit
        more hopeful of finishing the Ray Tracer Challenge in racket. They
        are default mutable
        and come with analogs for most of the standard list functions (map,
        filter, etc.). While I like pure functional programming and understand
        the value, mutability can provide great performance improvements
        in some cases (like
        ray tracing). I'll be using vectors in the canvas struct, which contains
        an RGB tuple for each pixel in the image we are trying to generate.
        I believe that the source of the issues I ran into in Haskell was precisely
        writing pixels to the canvas. Instead of having to copy the canvas to
        do writes, simply get a reference to the pixel data and update a color
        at a specific location. No need to worry about passing around and using
        as State monad (which I still have not figured out how to do), just update
        the value in place. This is exciting!

        <p>
        On a related note, I can never figure out a naming for "mathematical
        vectors" when using them alongside vector containers. I need to use
        the standard
        library's <code>make-vector</code> to create the pixel data container.
        This meant that I needed to rename my 3D vector (and point since they
        are both "tuples"). I've gone with <code>make-vector-3d</code> in
        this case, but I'd rather call the container an <i>ArrayList</i>
        instead.
        Or, since "list" is the default container type
        in racket, <i>Array</i> would work just fine and make sense.
