        This morning I came across an interesting post from Dan Luu on
        <a href="https://danluu.com/look-stupid/">looking stupid</a>. Some of
        the points brought up in this post resonate with me and I can
        understand the arguments being made for "looking stupid". From my
        perspective, this manifests most often due to asking extremely simple
        (some may say stupid) questions. I've noticed that the brightest people
        I have been around tend to ask alarmingly basic questions. Go to any
        martial arts gym and you will find that the most experienced and
        knowledgeable people in the room are the ones asking the most
        questions. There are a few reasons why I think this is the case:

        <ul>
          <li>
            Simple questions are easier to answer which allows the person asking
            them to more efficiently gather information from others. Over time,
            this has a powerful effect on building knowledge. The more
            answers, the better.
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking basic questions is the best way to understand why somebody
            else does something. Directly asking "Why?" often doesn't
            lead anywhere as even the best at something are not always
            conscious of the why. It is easier to teach and share what
            to do than why, as the "what" often leads to the "why".
          </li>
          <li>
            Those that excel tend to be great students; they are able to
            push down the part of them that wants to respond with "I know"
            and ask the question anyway. Strangely enough, it seems
            that it is possible to receive the same answer to the same question
            on multiple occasions and find that the outcome is different in
            each instance. A different context or the presence of new external
            information can help an old answer provide new insight.
          </li>
          <li>
            In many cases, things are much more simple than they can seem.
            It can seem stupid to ask obvious questions, but there is often
            an obvious answer. This prevents over-complicating simple things.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        As pointed out in the post above, if you are truly in a healthy learning
        environment then looking stupid is nothing to worry about. In order to
        learn, you have to put yourself out there and broadcast that you
        may not know something (gasp!). Ask simple questions, especially if they seem
        like they are "below" your level of knowledge. When everyone is bought
        in, this leads to a free flow of information and builds trust
        between those involved. This benefits the individual and the whole
        alike, and is something that almost any organization can benefit from.
        I think the post misses out on this aspect of "looking stupid"; it can
        actually have great social value as well.

        <p>
        Ask simple questions and look stupid.
