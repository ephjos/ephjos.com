        I love simple tools.

        <p>
        Reflecting on some of what I talked about
        <a href="/micro/2021/10/13">yesterday</a>,
        I realized something else about myself. While friction and
        resistance can be crippling, having too much freedom can be just as
        bad. I notice this particularly with tooling I use often. Bells and
        whistles do a great job of distracting me, and I will sink a
        disproportionate amount of time into something that is practically
        insignificant.

        <p>
        I think this part of my personality is what drew me to Linux.
        The opportunity for endless customization and control was exciting
        and pulled me in. I have spent countless hours customizing different
        dotfiles and settings, a lot of which I use less than once a month.
        While this is great educational value in this level of curiosity,
        it does sometimes get in the way.

        <p>
        I've found that by focusing on a small set of simple and extendable
        tools, I can get myself to focus on the problems I am trying to solve
        much easier. Now that I am familiar with these tools, I can use, tweak,
        update, and fix them without worry and (largely) without distraction.
        There are fewer moving parts, no batteries to charge, no oil to change:
        just a hammer to swing at a problem. While I understand and still
        feel the allure of cool screenshots and retro programs, I find I enjoy
        using a computer more by keeping it simple.
