        <p>
        When working on a piece of code, I am trying to be more mindful of
        assumptions. It is easy enough to write down my assumptions while
        reading code. This helps me check myself, and makes it easy to ask a
        teammate targeted questions that can be answered with relative ease.
        What's more difficult is checking external assumptions. In conversation,
        it can be tricky to navigate but useful to ask someone "Are you assuming
        X?". When done correctly, this can help everybody involved get on the
        same page and focus on the task at hand. We also have to watch out for
        assumptions in code we are monitoring. Some of these can be obvious,
        laid out in a comment. Much like listing your own assumptions, these
        are easy enough to verify. The danger comes from implicit assumptions.

        <p>
        We've all read and written functions that make assumptions about the
        parameters that they are passed. This is especially dangerous in a
        dynamically typed language, where any parameter can be any value.
        Static typing does not wholly prevent this problem as there may be
        edge cases within a type that must be accounted for. A function can
        verify that its parameter is a number, but if it divides by that number
        without checking it to be non-zero, then there are still dangerous
        assumptions in the code.

        <p>
        These dangers extend past parameters and into all logic within a
        program. We make assumptions about data flow, execution order, data
        models, etc. that are all core to what the code does. While some of
        these are unavoidable (i.e. synchronous code executes in order) we must
        be mindful of all internal and external assumptions. Err on the side
        of over communicating about these assumptions to better help your
        team understand the piece of code being discussed. Pay close attention
        to the code you read and write and be aware of any assumptions made
        within.

        <p>
        Always check assumptions.
