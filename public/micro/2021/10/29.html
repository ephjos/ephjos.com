        <p>
        As someone from the Northeast Philadelphia area, I grew up hearing
        people say things like "Keep that up and they'll have to put you
        in Byberry". My whole life, Byberry was just an abandoned
        place where they used to send "crazy" people. It wasn't until today,
        when I stumbled onto
        <a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/byberry-mental-hospital">
          an article about Byberry Mental hospital</a> that I got more
        detail on what actually happened there. The details in the article
        paint a revolting picture of a system that completely failed those
        who needed its help the most.

        <p>
        I have been interested
        in the history of asylums and mental health care in 20th century
        America since I went to the Pennhurst Asylum haunted attraction at
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennhurst_State_School_and_Hospital">
          Pennhurst State School</a>. I know many people find attractions like
        this disrespectful, but I can say that it was a catalyst to education
        for me. I would have never learned about the reality of what happened
        at Pennhurst, Byberry, and the whole United States were it not for
        this attraction. As a whole, this effort to help the mentally ill
        resulted in an unquantifiable amount of damage done instead. Lives were
        lost, innocent people suffered, and those responsible got away without
        any punishment.

        <p>
        When reading about places and atrocities like this, I can't shake the
        feeling that there is something similar going on today. Something that
        we are doing that is so obviously abhorrent that people will look on us
        with disgust in 50 years. In retrospect, these mental hospitals were
        clearly failures on every level. But, why could people not see it back
        then? How and why could they choose <i>not</i> to see it?

        <p>
        I think of Moriz Scheyer and something he said in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriz_Scheyer#Asylum">
          Asylum</a>, written about his escape of the Nazis as an Austrian
        Jew. During the occupation of France, Scheyer describe how every
        non-Jew did everything that they could to make money. Even the Nazi
        guards themselves would allow anything, should they be bribed with
        enough money. Scheyer gives the reader the sense that the majority of
        people were primarily motivated by greed and lust, either lying to
        themselves about or actually oblivious to the true cause of the Nazis.
        Wealthy French aristocrats threw themselves at the Nazis, just to
        be aligned with those in power
        <b>as they took their country by force and killed their fellow
        men, women, and children</b>.

        <p>
        What in people allows them to ignore such horrors for personal gain?
        What are we ignoring now?

        <p>
        What am <b>I</b> ignoring now?
