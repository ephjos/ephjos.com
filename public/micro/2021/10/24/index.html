        For as long as I have had some form of responsibility, I
        have dreaded Sundays. I would always find myself becoming
        stressed or upset at some point in the afternoon, feeling the
        freedom of the weekend falling away. Eventually, Monday would
        come and drag along with it classes, obligations, and eventually
        work. My understanding is that this is a common way to feel about
        the end of the weekend, and that most people attribute it to not
        enjoying what Monday brings. I don't think this is the case, at
        least for me.

        <p>
        I think this sense of dread comes from feeling like the weekend was
        missed or not properly used. The times where I've felt this most
        strongly were when I was not intentional with my time on the weekend.
        Inversely, when I am intentional about my time on the weekend I find
        myself looking forward to Monday more. This weekend was fairly action
        packed and ended with a solid chunk of hours mindlessly relaxing; I am
        excited to get back to work and solving problems tomorrow. I've also
        felt this way after weekends spent doing absolutely nothing.
        The problem comes from the weekend feeling like wasted potential,
        not having been properly used. I feel best when I feel like I have
        gotten something out of my time on the weekend.

        <p>
        Your enjoyment of Monday is a function of how you spent the weekend,
        more than what Monday will bring. Being intentional with time in
        the present prevents the future from "taking" that time away.
