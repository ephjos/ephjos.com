        I hate naming things. A name never feels  <i>right</i> to me. Whether
        it is a variable name, a game, an API route, or a team; names rarely
        come easy to me. Names can be too long, too short, too wordy, or just
        plain wrong. There always feels like there is a better name out
        there. One that encapsulates the idea perfectly and is just beyond my
        fingertips.

        <p>
        The best way forward is probably to go with my gut and stick by my
        decision.
