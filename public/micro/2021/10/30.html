        I am switching back to python and trying to finish the Ray
        Tracer Challenge. Had I not been detoured by different languages
        and ideas, I would have been done this project at the start of Covid.
        This being unfinished bothers me, so I am going to finish it. I am
        not enjoying the experience as much because of this, so I hope I
        can just get it done and then maybe circle back in the future to
        learn new languages and tools.
