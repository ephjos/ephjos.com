        From my limited experience, over-communicating seems like the best
        approach to default to. I find myself hesitating when feeling like I
        need to ask a question. In order to ask the question comfortably, I
        have to feel like I've done my work first. I hate the feeling of asking
        first, only to be told the answer is trivial. However, I've also found
        myself deep in a rabbit hole that I did not have to go down many times
        before as well. If I were to instead err on the side of
        over-communicating, I can quite easily correct back. Often, especially
        in high-paced work environments, people can be missing the full picture.
        By over sharing you can help prevent team members from being lost and
        aid them in accomplishing their goals. Under sharing leads to
        miscommunication which can have drastic consequences. Over sharing
        can be a temporary inconvenience.

        I was given some advice the other day:

        <blockquote>
          If you do not feel like you are over-communicating, then you are
          not communicating enough.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Over-communicate.
