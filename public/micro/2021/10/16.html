        <p>
        When working on a large project, knowing whether or not a pull request
        is "good" can be difficult. We can find ourselves in abstract
        discussions of what the best approach should be or leaving review
        that "maybe you could fix X too". While these conversations have value,
        they are not pragmatic and don't directly lead to code changes and PRs
        being merged.

        <p>
        I am working on having a mindset focused on incremental improvement.
        If a PR makes an undeniable improvement to the code base and does not
        introduce any bugs or debt, then it should
        be merged. If every PR can provide some improvement and be turned around
        quickly, a team can rapidly rid themselves of the problems they spend
        so much time discussing.

        <p>
        It is hard to walk the line between "fix everything" and "make
        the project better", but I think it can (and should) be done. Identify
        the core issues, create PRs to fix them, and merge the PRs. The ideal
        PR is likely
        <i>small and targeted</i> instead of
        <i>large and perfect</i>. Over time, the smaller PRs can be merged faster,
        provide a smaller surface area for bugs, and approach the perfect solution.
