        <p>
          I'm still playing around with
          <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">
            Ray Tracing In One Weekend</a>, this time by re-writing it in C.
          I wanted to implement this on CPU and play around with a little more
          than what my WebGL implementation had to offer. This way, I can
          do stuff like render a bunch of frames in a for loop and use ffmpeg
          to glue them together into a video (with a cool
          <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1608376">
            boomerang effect</a> too)!
        </p>

            Cannot render video in your browser
        </video>

        <p>
          I've got some code cleanup and performance improvements to take care
          of, and then I'll move on to
          <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html">
            The Next Week</a>.
