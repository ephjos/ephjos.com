      <h2> simple native C visualization using Xlib and ffmpeg </h2>

      <p>
      Since I set out to tackle this year's

        Advent of Code</a> using C, and I like
      making visualizations of some solutions, I needed
      a way to create visualizations from C code. Given
      this requirement, and a desire to work with Xlib, I set out
      to make a simple graphics header library to create these
      visualizations. After spending a lot of time searching
      the web, I found
      <a
          href="https://www3.nd.edu/~rbualuan/courses/fundcomp20/gfx/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noreferrer">
        gfx</a>, which is a great starting point. This
      library provides a simple way to create a window and draw
      some primitives to it.
      </p>

      <p>
      My initial concern was the lack of cleanup code present
      in gfx, so this is where I started. Delving into the
      amorphous and incomplete Xlib documentation was a pain, and
      I found that exploring the source code was a much more
      efficient way to understand the API. This was not a fun
      experience, but I managed to put something together that
      was usable and I am relatively happy with.
      </p>

      <p>
      I created cfx, a header-only Xlib wrapper for simple
      visualizations that can be saved straight to disk using
      ffmpeg. The

        source code can be found on my github</a>.

      After all of this work, I ended up making only two
      animations, but I am happy with how they came out.
