          Click the file input and choose an image. This image will be used as
          the input for running Conway's Game of Life. This is all done on
          the client with JavaScript.

          This is an update approach to the previous post that modifies the 
          pre-processing step. This version uses 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">
            Bayer Dithering</a> to produce a dithered monochrome image. The
          implementation is based on 
          <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7sfXDn">
            this Shadertoy example of Ordered Dithering</a>.
        </p>

          I came across the great 
          <a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">
            Ditherpunk</a> post again today, and had to try my hand at 
          a brief implementation. The pre-processed images now contain much 
          more detail, and the resulting Game of Life is different.
