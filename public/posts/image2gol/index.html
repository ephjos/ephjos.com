          Click the file input and choose an image. This image will be used as
          the input for running Conway's Game of Life. This is all done on
          the client with JavaScript.
        </p>

          This is a small idea I have had for a while, finally got around to
          throwing something together. Every few months I end up thinking about
          Conway's Game of Life again and want to implement it. It's cliche
          at this point, but I am continuously fascinated by the complexity
          that can emerge from such simple constraints.

          As-is, this performs a small animation iterating to progressively
          more constrained black and white versions of the input image, until it
          is reduced to 2 colors (black and white). Then, the Game of Life is
          started using that monochrome image (white is considered Alive).
          This implementation has fixed size, but allows wrapping around
          at the borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach is not the most interesting, and I imagine the input
          could be better preprocessed to enable more interesting results.
          One could apply some edge detection, blurring, or other scrambling
          to potentially introduce more initial noise.
