        It's been a while and I had the time, so I decided to implement the Ray
        Tracer Challenge again. I decided to restart with C and finish (render
        the cover image) from scratch. Some of what I've learned in the
        Performance Aware Programming course came in handy and this is by far
        my fastest implementation of this ray tracer so far. I didn't put much
        explicit effort into performance, instead I just tried to avoid wasting
        CPU time and things worked out pretty well.

      </video>

        I rendered a bunch of frames of the cover image and stitched them
        together into the video above. In the optimized build, each 1000x1000
        frame took around 5.5s with a 5 bounce depth. This is roughly 20,000
        cycles per pixel (thanks RDTSC). It is amazing how fast software can be
        if keep your code simple and stay focused on transforming your data.
