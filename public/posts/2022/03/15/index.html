        I watched a great video from 3Blue1Brown today, and it reminded me
        of what it was like to first wrap my head around the Monty Hall problem
        as a CS undergrad. The video,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkmNXy7er84">The Hardest Problem on the Hardest Test</a>,
        is about a question from a Putnam Competition. Finding the solution is
        a matter of reframing the problem and changing perspective. Once viewed
        from the correct lens, the answer seems trivial.

          From
          <a href="/posts/2021/10/26">my post on 10/26/2021</a> when
          discussing the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">
            Monty Hall problem</a>.

          <blockquote>
            Instead of focusing on the probability that
            you pick the prize, focus on the probability that you initially pick a
            goat. If 2/3 of the time you pick a goat, and you are always shown one
            goat, switching results in you picking the car 2/3 of the time.

          I know I've discussed this before on this blog, but this skill is
          something that I have been working to develop ever since exposed to
          it. In CS, we spend a ton of work on formulating efficient data
          structures and algorithms and then reframe the problem to fit
          these abstractions. This gets to the core of what I find so
          interesting about computer science, and seeing another example
          of it in the wild is always intriguing.
