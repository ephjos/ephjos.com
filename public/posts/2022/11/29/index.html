          I recently went through the
          <a
            href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/"
          >Build Your Own Text Editor</a>
          tutorial. This booklet goes over building a simple terminal-based
          text editor in C. The editor itself has no dependencies (outside of
          the standard library) and is supposed to be decently portable.
          The editor itself is

          I thought that the project was interesting and definitely provided
          a large amount of useful information. The most valuable aspect
          of these tutorials for me is seeing how someone else writes software.
          I'd read the description of a section and have a rough idea of what
          the implementation would look like; only to have the author do
          something different.
          Sometimes, I see patterns that I do not want to implement myself.
          Other times I find new ways of doing things that I will adopt
          myself.
          In traditional CS and programming education we spend the bulk of our
          time in the abstract. Being able to dive into concrete examples
          provides a different but still useful experience.

          For this tutorial, I was surprised by the high-level architecture
          with respect to rendering. The core rendering code looks like it was
          pulled straight from a game engine, being written in an immediate
          mode style. This makes sense, given the context of this being
          a terminal application, but the similarity to game code was a
          surprise nonetheless. I also got to see a different approach
          to strings in C than I've seen before. I'll be looking to brush
          up on my <code>memset</code> skills thanks to this tutorial.
          I also gained some more appreciation for the curses libraries,
          given how difficult it is to interact with the terminal without them.

          All-in-all, I'd recommend going through this tutorial. It was
          enjoyable throughout and has given me some ideas I want to play
          with some more. For languages like C, where there is no single "way",
          reading other people's code provides a valuable perspective.
