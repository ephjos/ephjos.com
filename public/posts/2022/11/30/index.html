          I pushed some changes to this site yesterday:
          <ul>
            <li>Moved everything from <code>/blog</code> and <code>/micro</code> under <code>/posts</code></li>
            <li>Consolidated everything to a single RSS feed</li>
            <li>Upgraded to redbean version 2.2</li>
            <li>Renewed the SSL certs</li>
            <li>Killed unneeded processes on the host</li>
            <li>Added DDoS protection using <a href="https://redbean.dev/#tools">blackholed.com</a></li>
            <li>Pulled all configuration into the repo and made deployment more hermetic</li>
            <li>Run redbean with strict sandboxing (<code>-SSS</code>)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          As always, the goal is to make the process of writing as simple as possible here,
          and I feel that these changes are steps in that direction. Its been
          great to watch the ecosystem around redbean slowly grow, and I am
          excited to see where it goes in the future. For now, the host machine
          this server runs on no longer runs nginx, fail2ban, or docker; which
          is pretty cool.
