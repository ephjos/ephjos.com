          I'll be updating this post with my
          thoughts on each day
          throughout the challenge. The full source for my solutions
          can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/ephjos/aoc/tree/master/y2022">in this git repo</a>.
          I was looking into using zig or c this year, but I am going to go
          with python. I think this will be the fastest way for me to complete
          each challenge, which is a priority for me this year.

          <h3>Day 01</h3>
          <p>
            Today was a typical AoC Day 1. Part 1 was a simple string split on
            <code>"\n\n"</code> and then a max of sums. Part 2 was sorting
            these sums and returning the sum of the 3 largest. I'm happy to
            be kicking things off again this year. As-is, I am pretty happy with
            my template.

          <h3>Day 02</h3>
          <p>
            These problems were straightforward, but my solution was a bit of
            a mess. The key insight (I think) is to map the input chars to
            their numbers and then perform arithmetic with modulus 3 on the
            result. I think this would give the answers in the cleanest way
            possible, but I know that I always struggle with 1-indexed
            modulus, so I wrote out some extra if statements that I
            was sure are correct. I managed to get ranks 1270 and 858
            respectively, which I am happy about. Maybe I'll polish
            this solution up in the morning.

          <h3>Day 03</h3>
          <p>
            This was one of those days where I did not see an obvious easy
            answer until I was working on the second part: use set
            intersections. Once I realized this, I refactored my part 1 and
            it seems to read a bit better. Also, I'm sure there is an easier
            way to map from chars to "type", but I used a dict in my
            implementation. I enjoyed these 2 problems.

          <h3>Day 04</h3>
          <p>
            Another day where sets come to the rescue! I was initially going
            to use a simple dataclass to track each range, but I realized
            that sets may be a better choice. The first part was checking
            for supersets and the second part was checking if the
            intersection was non-null. I complicated things for myself
            by insisting on using a list comprehension to parse the input,
            which is something I don't like doing: but I got the problem
            solved fairly quickly. Today was fun!
          </p>

          <h3>Day 05</h3>
          <p>
            This was a good problem, but I did not sort out the parsing
            as fast as I would have liked. I went down the path of trying
            to split the input strings from the start, when I should
            have thought for a moment first: using direct string
            indices works better. I figured we wouldn't have a scaling
            issue in part 2 as this is only day 5, so I went ahead
            and implemented the stacks as described in the
            problem. For part 2, I pushed to a temporary stack
            during the swap and then pushed to the destination pile in
            reverse. I could have done this in a different way, but I was
            confident I would get this approach correct faster.
