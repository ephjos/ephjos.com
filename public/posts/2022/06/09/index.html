          On a recent episode of the Tim Ferris Show
          podcast, Tim Ferris had a conversation with Morgan Housel whose work
          <a href="/posts/2021/11/28">has inspired me before</a>. I would
          recommend the episode overall, but there was one small observation
          from Morgan that has been stuck in my head
          (<a href="https://tim.blog/2022/03/05/morgan-housel-the-psychology-of-money-transcript/">full transcript</a>):

        <blockquote>
... there’s a friend of mine named Carl Richards, who’s a financial advisor, and he has a quote where he says, “Risk is what is left over when you think you’ve thought of everything.” And I think that’s the definition of risk is whenever we’re done planning and forecasting, everything that’s left over that we haven’t thought about, that’s what risk actually is. And the takeaway from that, the actual practical takeaway is that if you are only planning for risks that you can think about and you can envision and you can imagine, then 10 times out of 10, you’re going to miss the biggest risk that actually hits you.
        </blockquote>

          As with a lot of Morgan's insight this was presented in the context of
          finance and investing. However, his observations often apply in a
          much more general context. When I heard this, my mind immediately
          went to how I look at building software.

          I've often had the problem where I start working on a new idea and
          make decent progress, only to run into a snag that pokes holes in
          my overall approach. At this point, I'd have to start back over with
          my new perspective and take another crack at the problem. I had
          always wondered why this happened, and what I could do to mitigate it.
          I'd agonize about potential architectures and approaches that could
          best solve the problem and find myself reluctant to start for fear
          of taking the wrong approach. Morgan's observation is that this
          is not something to fear, and is something that is hard to prevent.
          It is precisely the things that you don't account for that will
          trip you up, and it is nearly impossible to take <i>everything</i>
          into account.

          A thread on HackerNews put me onto a few great talks, all starting
          with
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk">
            Preventing the Collapse of Civilization by Jonathan Blow
          </a>. This is a great talk in its own right, but for the purpose
          of this post it served as the springboard into
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUj1EZwpJY">
            The Only Unbreakable Law by Casey Muratori
          </a>. In this talk, Casey builds up to and elaborates on something
          known as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">
            Conway's Law
          </a>. This law states that organizations will produce output whose
          structure is a copy of the organization's. Casey provides a few
          great examples, most clearly how the structure of the Windows team
          at Microsoft influenced the final operating system. The existence
          of separate Direct Audio and Direct Input teams resulted in there
          being two distinct software packages for handling audio and input.
          These libraries, along with others, were wrapped under the DirectX
          API, which was the overall product of the department
          that contained all of the Direct teams.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a few core ideas here, but the one that clicked for me was
          the idea that by defining a structure of organization, the
          organization is inherently limited in the space of output it can
          produce. From the Wikipedia page above, "If you have four groups
          working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass compiler." In other words,
          four groups working on a compiler are unable to make a 1-pass
          compiler. There may be areas where it would make sense for the teams
          to collaborate and avoid repeating work or find optimizations, but
          the communication
          costs for the 4 teams is too great. In order to coordinate that many
          people on the project, they have to be put on teams. The way teams
          are broken up will directly influence the shape of the output.
        </p>

        <p>
          An organization, by its construction, may be incapable of producing
          the best solution for the problem that the organization was created
          to solve. However, some of these "optimal" solutions may not be able
          to be formed into an organization. A single person can only hold
          a certain amount of information in their head. There will be a point
          where responsibility must be divided. Where this division is drawn
          will directly impact the amount of possible outputs possible. These
          observations apply to any organization, be it a company or the
          layout of code.

          There are limits on what we can plan for. Trying to identify all
          of the risks directly
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">
            changes what our risks are</a>. We don't know what the best
          solution to a problem is
          before we find it. The way we organize our approach to the
          problem directly restricts the set of solutions we can find.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't obsess over planning, focus on doing. Organize only where
          absolutely necessary.
