          During a visit to Salem Massachusetts last year, I stumbled onto
          Arthur Miller's The Crucible in a bookshop. I figured
          there wouldn't be a better place to grab a copy, so I bought it and
          forgot about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, I enjoyed the story. It was quick read and I
          enjoyed that most of the characters were ripped straight from
          actual events that occurred during the witch trials. Knowing about
          Giles Corey and his pressing makes the impact of it in the story
          much more intense. Remembering the spot where it occurred, how the
          townspeople would have gathered to watch him be slowly crushed.
          Recognizing a character's name from his real gravestone was an
          impactful experience, and one I hope I don't repeat.

          The frantic
          dialog and the general absurdity made the play chaotic and
          engaging, and definitely made its message clear. As an allegory for
          McCarthyism, Miller did a great job of showing the lengths
          people will go to when they believe they are morally correct.
          The pervasiveness of this behavior pattern across time and
          place is alarming, and fits in to many situations we face in
          modern life.
        </p>

          To those in the midst of this mania, everything seems clear: the
          Devil has fallen upon Salem. Only
          with time does the chaos and confusion of the past become clear.
