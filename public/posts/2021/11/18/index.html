        Sandi Metz has a great short article called
        <a href="https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction">
          The Wrong Abstraction</a>. As software developers, we spend a lot
        of our time and effort on abstractions. All of us understand what
        it is like to run up against a bad abstraction that just doesn't
        seem to fit the problem. The interesting angle that Sandi takes
        is to <i>prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction</i>, due
        to the disproportionate cost of bad abstractions. This is an
        interesting idea that makes for an approach that only adds
        abstractions once they are needed and obvious, or when the code
        becomes <i>too</i> repetitive. To untangle an existing abstraction,
        simply locate the places the abstraction is used and copy/paste
        the abstraction inline. This provides the benefit of immediately
        removing the dependency while providing the ability to more readily
        identify and define a better abstraction.

        <p>
        All in all, this post is based on a simple idea, but it is a slight
        shift in the way to approach problems that most of us are taught.
        Instead of focusing on the existing abstraction and fitting the
        problem to it, focus on removing bad/unneeded abstractions and only
        add them where they truly provide value.
