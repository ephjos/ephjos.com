        In the last post I talked about the performance of the ray tracer
        I am writing in python and found myself quite unhappy. I did some
        digging into alternate interpreters and found
        <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">
          pypy</a> which does JIT compilation and focuses on long running
        computationally intense tasks. It sounded up for the job, so I installed
        it, got the right pip version and installed some packages, then ran it.

        <p>
        The cover image from the last post took ~17 minutes to render at 300px
        by 300px. With pypy, the same image is rendered in ~4 minutes. In about
        ~20 minutes, I was able to render it in 800px by 800px. This is all
        a substantial improvement, and I am happy that it'll help speed up
        my work until I get to more optimizations. I am also able to push
        the rewrite in a compiled language into the future as I don't
        think it'll be required for me to finish the book and render some
        images.

        Today is Thanksgiving, and I am deeply thankful for all of the people
        and things that make life worth living. I feel grateful for life
        itself and everything that comes with it, the good and the bad. Being
        alive is a great thing.

        <p>
        Happy Thanksgiving!
