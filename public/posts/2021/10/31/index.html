        From what I have read, it seems to me that the most successful people
        in any field are those who are able to consistently have
        deeply valuable bursts. They are not the people who slog away working
        80 hour weeks for the sake of working more. Rather, they work long
        hours when it will produce the desired result. Cal Newport's
        <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">
          Deep Work</a> touches on this idea a lot, and I can see this idea
        echoed elsewhere.

        <p>
        It is not about doing more work, it is about doing
        better work more often. This meta skill seems to be almost more
        important than the "core" skill itself. For a given field, a competent
        person who can routinely "go deep" will likely have better results
        than someone who is better at the core skill.
        After a certain level, it is not about knowing more, but about being
        able to apply what you know more deeply and more often.
