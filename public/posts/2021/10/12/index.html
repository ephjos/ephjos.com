        After some discussions about unit tests at work yesterday, I came across
        this solid <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/356238">StackExchange</a>
        post. It turns out my understanding of the ways that a unit test can be
        brittle were fairly limited, meaning I missed a few of the bad ways to
        write unit tests. In particular, I previously would add in additional
        checks that "just made sure" for different values/functionality along
        the way. Often, these checks were almost completely orthogonal to the target
        of the unit test. I saw this as more stable (more tests = better)
        not as more brittle. But, now I understand the perspective that
        extraneous assertions can lead to tests failing even when their "core"
        tests pass. A rule of thumb to try going forward: strive to have
        only 1 assert per unit test. While this is admittedly impractical and
        not always the best approach, I think it is the kind of correction
        I need to make in my approach.

        <p>
        On a different note, Ethan Chlebowski's recipe for
        <a href="https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/street-cart-chicken-amp-yellow-rice">halal cart style chicken and rice</a>
        is fantastic. I didn't think it would be so easy to recreate a
        freshman year favorite of mine at home. If I exercise control
        by making the salad portion bigger, rice portion smaller, and using a touch less
        sauce, this is actually a solid healthy meal.

        <p>
        The most important
        contribution Ethan has made to my cooking is his mayo marinade technique
        which is applied in the above recipe. Instead of oil, marinate your
        meat in a seasoned mayo which is oil+egg+vinegar. This results in
        more tender, juicer meat with the bonus of not having to worry about
        putting fat in the pan: the meat brings enough fat to cook it from
        the marinade. The usage of mayo here also provides incredible color
        to the finished product, which is always great to have.
