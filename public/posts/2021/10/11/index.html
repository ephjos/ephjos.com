        Thanks to Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder 3 causing me to stay up until
        1:30am Saturday night, I am beat this morning. It was well worth it.
        I am hoping a good workout
        and some caffeine will help before the real work of the day begins.

        <p>
        I have found myself spending more and more time reviewing PRs, which
        has been a great experience. This doesn't feel like it is cutting into
        my other work and is helping me keep up with my team and get a better
        understanding of the project as a whole. By time-boxing it to an hour
        or two a day, I can ensure that I have time to fulfill my personal
        responsibilities while still being accountable to the team. To
        me, the biggest benefit of PR review besides QA and bug mitigation
        is the sharing of knowledge.

        <p>
        A good PR should cleanly explain what the changes are, why they were
        made, and what issues still exist in the affected code or linger
        around the edges. This gives the reviewer a clear picture of the
        motivation, allowing them to more easily see if the code completes
        its objectives. The why gives insight into that developer's
        perspective on the project as a whole, the issue in specific, and
        their general problem solving approach. This can be incredibly
        insightful, especially as a relatively new engineer, as it provides
        a clear window into how my colleagues see things. When done well,
        this can be a direct transfer of skills and knowledge that allows
        the reviewer to become a better developer themselves.

        <p>
        Finishing with
        the remaining issues and other concerns helps share that developer's
        perspective on what work still has to be done. This spreads
        project specific information which can help eliminate borders in
        knowledge. It is never good to have a part of the code that
        "only X understands, go ask them". While levels of expertise and
        understanding vary, everyone on the team should have a minimally
        workable understanding of each part of the codebase. This makes
        the team more resilient to outside events while again
        pushing each member's boundaries and ultimately making them better
        at what they do.

        <p>
        If a team can consistently open concise, well explained PRs
        that provide meaningful information and definitive improvements to
        their project, both the final product and the engineers themselves will
        improve. Do this for a period of time and a deeply valuable product
        and team can be built. To be kitschy:
        <blockquote>
          software development is about developing software as much as
          it is about developing the people who create it
