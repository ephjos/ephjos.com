        I found the fantastic personal website of Derek Sivers yesterday.
        Just from the
        brief look I've taken around the website, I can tell that there is a
        bunch more reading to be done.
        While browsing I stumbled on to his post about
        <a href="https://sive.rs/daydream">daydreaming</a>.
        While short, I found it interesting as I've largely stopped daydreaming.
        There is always some form of stimulus between computers, phones, and
        TVs that there is no room for boredom. Even when I can get hooked on
        a book, which feels like a productive use of time, I am still
        <i>consuming</i> information. The final line of this post has been
        bouncing around in my head since I read it:

        <blockquote>
          <b>We’ve all had plenty of input.</b>
          It’s fun to let your mind direct its own entertainment.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Less input, more output.

        And, since I don't think I've actually committed to it in writing, my
        plan for these posts is this.

        <ul>
          <li>
            I will post everyday for 30 days straight.
          </li>
          <li>
            After that, there will be no fixed schedule but this is where
            all of my shorter posts will live. The main blog is where all
            longer form writing will go.
          </li>
        </ul>
