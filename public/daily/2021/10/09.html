        I've always wanted to write a somewhat substantial program
        using a Lisp. I was first introduced to the family of languages in
        a programming languages course: good-old MIT Scheme. This was
        such a foreign experience at the time both around tooling and the
        language itself. This opened up a whole other world of programming
        languages that led to me finding Haskell and Racket. However,
        I've never written anything too complex with either (aside from the
        <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node76.html">SICP metacircular evaluator</a>).

        <p>
        There has been an ongoing cycle of start-stop-delete with my attempts at
        <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/">The Ray Tracer Challenge</a>,
        which will warrant a more lengthy post. These days, I am working through
        this book in Racket. Just in the first chapter I've learned a bit more
        about the language and its tooling, and I look forward to the rest.

        <p>
        I am thinking about stopping and just crunching through the book in
        Python to get myself all the way through it. Maybe a first pass with
        relatively low friction will help me actually get through it using
        the other languages I have in mind. So far focusing on reducing friction
        and finsihing things has served me well, so maybe that's what it needed
        here.

        <p>
        I also still need to bring over a couple of my old blog posts to this
        version of the site.
