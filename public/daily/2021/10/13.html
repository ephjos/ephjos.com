        Last year, in the first summer of the pandemic, I listened to James
        Clear's
        <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> on
        audiobook during my workouts. I found the ideas discussed within
        to be fascinating and their application to be more intriguing. Of all
        of the ideas discussed in the book, the most well known is probably the
        idea of habit chaining. The idea here is that it is near impossible to
        take on a bunch of new habits simultaneously, especially when they are
        all disconnected. Instead, it is easier to "attach" a habit to an
        existing one. If you want to write every morning, and you already have
        the habit of waking up and making a cup of coffee, you can try chaining
        writing onto the existing habit. Instead of trying to "write a blog post
        everyday", aim to "write for 10 minutes <i>after</i> making coffee". This is
        a smaller habit that builds up your existing system. There is lower
        friction when trying to start the new task, since you are riding on
        the momentum of your existing habit. With coffee in hand, you are
        already prepped for and 10 minutes of writing away from completing
        the task. Once you are writing everyday, it is easy to increase the
        amount of time spent writing since you already have the habit of starting.

        <p>
        Remove the need
        for motivation and instead make what you want to do easy, and what
        you don't want to do hard. Its easier to eat healthy if you only have
        healthy foods in the house; it is hard to east unhealthy if you only
        have healthy foods in the house. This resonates with me the most
        since I tend to <i>over-perceive</i> the amount of friction involved
        in tasks.

        <p>
        When not part of a habit, simple tasks can become daunting and take
        me a while to decide to do. I find that by trying to see the
        true level of friction, I can "motivate" myself to do these tasks much
        easier. Instead of being worried about how complicated a new feature
        may be and how long it will take to implement and all of the potential
        bugs that may be introduced: just start. Version control is a great
        tool which allows us to undo or fix changes with ease.

        <p>
        For me, habits are best built by lowering the cognitive effort necessary
        to start them, increasing the friction of the opposite task, and spending
        what cognitive effort is necessary to analyze the true friction of the
        task. It is less about finding the motivation than it is about
        overcoming this "resistance" towards all tasks. Given these traits,
        I seem to function best by simplifying the tools and systems around
        me. I've found that
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">"Keep It Simple, Stupid"</a>
        tends to work for me.
