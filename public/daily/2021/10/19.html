        <p>
        One of the first lessons you should learn once you become interested in
        personal finance is that compounding interest is one of the most
        powerful tools for building wealth. Over large time scales, small
        compounding interest can have incredible effects. Getting 5% interest
        on repeated savings can lead to doubling your money in about 30 years;
        and lead to tripling it in 40. The gradual nature of this growth
        means that gains are not apparent for the majority of the time. After
        investing a significant amount of time and resources, compounding
        interest starts to take over. In the above example, the 40th year of
        interest provides the same gain as the first ~18 combined. Exponential
        growth seems to be unintuitive and can seem insignificant, barely
        greater than linear for most of the time.

        <p>
        I once heard the following puzzle that someone was using to help educate
        people about compounding and exponential growth.

        <blockquote>
          There is a lake with nothing else but a single lily pad. Every day,
          the amount of lily pads doubles. If it takes the lily pads 50
          days to cover the entire lake, how long does it take them to cover
          half of it?
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        49 days, doubling on the last day to cover the whole lake. The
        fascinating thing to me was how sudden this burst at the end is. At day
        45, the lily pads only take up 3% of the lake's surface area. The growth
        for these first 45 was slow and largely undetectable day-to-day. The
        last 5 days see a jump from 3% to 100% coverage. After a quick search,
        here is a resource with this same scenario from a University of Washington professor:
        <a href="https://atmos.uw.edu/~dennis/211_Exponential_Growth.pdf">Information sheet on exponential growth</a>.

        <p>
        I believe that this pattern can be seen everywhere, especially in
        software projects.
        Small investments that can be made on a regular basis provide a
        seemingly disproportionate return over time. I think most developers
        have seen this on a shorter time scale, say a couple of months. First,
        there are a couple months of PRs that fix bugs and refactor code
        without providing much value to the end user. Then, seemingly out of
        nowhere, there are a handful of PRs that have a cascading effect leading
        to dozens of issues being closed. The reality is that <i>all</i> of the
        work done in those few months is responsible for the fixes at the end,
        just that there needed to be a significant investment before
        the true return could be realized.

        <p>
        This is the core idea behind James Clear's
        <a href="https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement">1% better every day</a>
        idea, which was deeply profound to me the first time I came across it.

        <p>
        Small continuous improvements lead to compounding growth.
