        <p>
        Another slight mindset shift I am trying to make is to focus on
        problems, not solutions. This idea is parroted around a lot especially
        in online-entrepreneur-influencer circles, but I think it does have
        some value. As someone who can obsess over what the "best"
        solution to a problem is and make the entire process much more difficult
        for
        himself, this tweak may prove helpful. Instead of being occupied
        purely with the solution, pour more time and effort into learning about
        the problem. The classic questions of who, what, where, when, why, and
        how are all of the tools needed here.

        <p>
        The core hypothesis behind this idea is that a good solution should be
        evident from the problem, once you have enough data about the problem.
        Instead of languishing about large-scale architecture mistakes and
        refactors, focus on the specific issue at hand. If the original author
        is still on the team, reach out to them for some information. A quick
        slack message may illuminate something before unseen to you. Identify
        exactly what the issue is, and try to keep this definition targeted.
        Pinpoint exactly where in both the code and the product this issue
        occurs. Enumerate every place where this is the case, which may be
        helpful for testing at the end. Understand what decisions/mistakes led
        to this issue being checked-in to the code base. List out all of the
        different manners in which the issue can be caused. Is it reproducible?
        Is it deterministic? Given all of this information on top of the code
        itself, clearly explain how the issue occurs. From code decisions to
        what manifests to the end user, you should be able to explain each step
        along the way and what key pieces lead to the final result.

        <p>
        With this detailed of a view on the problem, a list of potential
        solutions should become immediately clear. Rank these solutions and
        get feedback from team members (if necessary) before moving forward with
        the best choice. Don't treat this is as a binding agreement: more
        information may become available while working on this fix that reveals
        another solution as a better choice. If unconstrained by time, feel free
        to switch to the new approach.

        <p>
        Instead of focusing on the solution, obsess over the problem. Gather
        info and make an educated decision on how to best tackle the problem.
        The end goal is to fix the issue, not to create an elegant solution.
        If the investigation into the problem is done right, this should
        happen largely on its own.

        <p>
        Well defined problems reveal elegant solutions.
