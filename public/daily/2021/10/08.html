        So about that whole "rss feed by hand" thing.

        <p>
        I spent some time this morning writing a couple bash scripts
        that iterate over the files for both blogs and
        generates each their own rss feed <i>and</i> index page. This greatly
        reduces the amount of work necessary for each post, while also forcing
        me to stay in this simple format.

        <p>
        Yes, I am looking at the inflexibility of a hacked together bash script
        as a feature, not a bug in this case. I also committed the sin of
        using regex to parse text out of HTML, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454"
        >but I think I'll be okay</a>.

        <p>
        All in all, I am pretty happy with how everything works right now. To
        create a post I copy my template file to the new post, write it, and
        run a bash script before pushing git and docker. As long as I follow
        some simple formatting that my scripts expect, all should be well.

        <p>
        I also noticed some super strange caching behavior when testing the
        site on my other devices yesterday, so I am pushing a change to stop
        caching. These pages are small and lightweight enough that it shouldn't
        matter, future me can worry about that.
