        <description><![CDATA[
                <p>         Thanks to Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder 3 causing me to stay up until         1:30am Saturday night, I am beat this morning. It was well worth it.         I am hoping a good workout         and some caffeine will help before the real work of the day begins.          <p>         I have found myself spending more and more time reviewing PRs, which         has been a great experience. This doesn't feel like it is cutting into         my other work and is helping me keep up with my team and get a better         understanding of the project as a whole. By time-boxing it to an hour         or two a day, I can ensure that I have time to fulfill my personal         responsibilities while still being accountable to the team. To         me, the biggest benefit of PR review besides QA and bug mitigation         is the sharing of knowledge.          <p>         A good PR should cleanly explain what the changes are, why they were         made, and what issues still exist in the affected code or linger         around the edges. This gives the reviewer a clear picture of the         motivation, allowing them to more easily see if the code completes         its objectives. The why gives insight into that developer's         perspective on the project as a whole, the issue in specific, and         their general problem solving approach. This can be incredibly         insightful, especially as a relatively new engineer, as it provides         a clear window into how my colleagues see things. When done well,         this can be a direct transfer of skills and knowledge that allows         the reviewer to become a better developer themselves.          <p>         Finishing with         the remaining issues and other concerns helps share that developer's         perspective on what work still has to be done. This spreads         project specific information which can help eliminate borders in         knowledge. It is never good to have a part of the code that         "only X understands, go ask them". While levels of expertise and         understanding vary, everyone on the team should have a minimally         workable understanding of each part of the codebase. This makes         the team more resilient to outside events while again         pushing each member's boundaries and ultimately making them better         at what they do.          <p>         If a team can consistently open concise, well explained PRs         that provide meaningful information and definitive improvements to         their project, both the final product and the engineers themselves will         improve. Do this for a period of time and a deeply valuable product         and team can be built. To be kitschy:         <blockquote>           software development is about developing software as much as           it is about developing the people who create it         </blockquote>

                <p>         I've hit that point in implementing a ray tracer where I need to         start implementing structs that have 2D arrays. This is needed         for the canvas' pixels and eventually in the matrix implementation.         This is straightforward enough in an imperative language, but has been         a sticking point in the past.          <p>         After some brief research, Racket's mutable vectors seem easy enough to         use, and are probably exactly what I need in this case. I want to         try to avoid building up thunks in these areas of the code as that         can lead to a massive space leak (as I've learned in the past).          <p>         If Racket's vectors are anything like those from Haskell, I'll         most likely wind up falling back to Python just to finish this project.          <p>         Wish me luck.

        <description><![CDATA[
                <p>         I've always wanted to write a somewhat substantial program         using a Lisp. I was first introduced to the family of languages in         a programming languages course: good-old MIT Scheme. This was         such a foreign experience at the time both around tooling and the         language itself. This opened up a whole other world of programming         languages that led to me finding Haskell and Racket. However,         I've never written anything too complex with either (aside from the         <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node76.html">SICP metacircular evaluator</a>).          <p>         There has been an ongoing cycle of start-stop-delete with my attempts at         <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/">The Ray Tracer Challenge</a>,         which will warrant a more lengthy post. These days, I am working through         this book in Racket. Just in the first chapter I've learned a bit more         about the language and its tooling, and I look forward to the rest.          <p>         I am thinking about stopping and just crunching through the book in         Python to get myself all the way through it. Maybe a first pass with         relatively low friction will help me actually get through it using         the other languages I have in mind. So far focusing on reducing friction         and finsihing things has served me well, so maybe that's what it needed         here.          <p>         I also still need to bring over a couple of my old blog posts to this         version of the site.

                <p>         So about that whole "rss feed by hand" thing.          <p>         I spent some time this morning writing a couple bash scripts         that iterate over the files for both blogs and         generates each their own rss feed <i>and</i> index page. This greatly         reduces the amount of work necessary for each post, while also forcing         me to stay in this simple format.          <p>         Yes, I am looking at the inflexibility of a hacked together bash script         as a feature, not a bug in this case. I also committed the sin of         using regex to parse text out of HTML, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454"         >but I think I'll be okay</a>.          <p>         All in all, I am pretty happy with how everything works right now. To         create a post I copy my template file to the new post, write it, and         run a bash script before pushing git and docker. As long as I follow         some simple formatting that my scripts expect, all should be well.          <p>         I also noticed some super strange caching behavior when testing the         site on my other devices yesterday, so I am pushing a change to stop         caching. These pages are small and lightweight enough that it shouldn't         matter, future me can worry about that.

              <p>       This is my first daily post. I am not really sure what this       will turn out to be, but I do want to see how far I can take it.       This will just be a place to jot down what's on my mind at       the time. Posts like projects or other more involved writing       will go in the main blog.        <p>       As of now, I am working on laying the website out again (for I       believe the 6th time). I am keeping the majority of the       UI/UX the same, but moving completely to a plain HTML/CSS/JS       stack.        <p>       I found out about SSI (Server Side Includes) the other day,       so I don't even need to use an external templating system.       Just set <code>ssi on</code> in nginx and get up and running.       This lets me share the head, navbar, and footer between pages       easily which was always my main deterrent from dropping all       the way down to bare HTML.        <p>       I've previously told myself that I don't like writing HTML and       that I <b>needed</b> a markdown setup in order to write, but       that certainly didn't lead to more writing.        <p>       So now, everything is dead simple. These posts don't       even really need markup, and in the cases that they do I'm       sure I'll get around to adding some useful snippets to my       vim config.        <p>       Creating the index pages and rss feed by hand is a bit strange,       but the whole theme of this effort is to <i>just do it</i>.        <p>       Here it goes!
