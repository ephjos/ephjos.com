      I'm Joe and I am a Software Developer at
      <a

        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        class="umami--click--cesium-link"
        target="_blank">Cesium</a>. The bulk of my professional
      experience is in
      front end web development, but I am interested in everything related
      to computing. I am working on becoming a better full stack
      developer while also picking up other skills along the way.
      I often spend my spare time on small projects to learn new things in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming languages</li>
        <li>Computer Graphics</li>
        <li>Game Development</li>
        <li>AI/Vision</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      I also want to get better at writing, which is the purpose of this blog.
      The goal here is to become more thoughtful about my work and in general,
      while also keeping myself honest and focusing on finishing projects.
