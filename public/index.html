      Hi, I'm Joe and I am a Software Engineer at
      <a
        href="https://ocient.com/"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        target="_blank">Ocient</a>.
      Everything related
      to computing is fascinating to me and
      I often spend my spare time on small projects to learn new things about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming Languages</li>
        <li>Computer Graphics</li>
        <li>Game Development</li>
        <li>Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Computer Vision</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      I also want to get better at writing, which is one of the core goals of
      maintaining this website.
      </p>
